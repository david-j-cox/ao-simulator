AO Simulator — Outstanding Work & Roadmap
==========================================
Last updated: 2026-02-17


=== INFRASTRUCTURE & DEVOPS ===

[ ] Pin backend Python dependencies (requirements.txt has no versions)
[ ] Add .env.example with documented environment variables
    - Backend port, CORS origins, log level
    - Frontend API base URL
[ ] Dockerfile + docker-compose for single-command local setup
[ ] GitHub Actions CI pipeline
    - Run backend unit tests (pytest)
    - Run frontend build check (vite build)
    - Run e2e tests (Playwright)
    - Lint checks (eslint + ruff/flake8)
[ ] Hosted deployment setup (cloud platform TBD)
    - Production Dockerfile with frontend static build served by backend
    - Health check endpoint
    - Environment-based config (dev vs prod CORS, debug, etc.)
[ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md with setup instructions, coding standards, PR process
[ ] Add LICENSE file (MIT per README, but no LICENSE file exists yet)


=== TESTING ===

[ ] Backend unit tests (pytest)
    - Schedule classes (FR, VR, FI, VI edge cases)
    - Agent behavior (Q-learning convergence, ETBD selection, MPR coupling)
    - Runner single-condition and multi-condition logic
    - API route validation (bad inputs, missing fields, boundary values)
    - CSV/JSON output format correctness
[ ] Frontend unit tests (vitest or similar)
    - Component rendering
    - buildRequest() output for single and multi-condition
    - Cumulative record data computation
[ ] Expand e2e tests
    - All 3 algorithms x 2 environments (6 combos)
    - CSV/JSON download content verification
    - Error handling (invalid config, server down)
    - Large step count performance


=== NEW ALGORITHMS ===

[ ] Rescorla-Wagner model (classical conditioning / associative learning)
[ ] Actor-Critic (reinforcement learning with separate policy and value)
[ ] Linear Operator Model (Bush & Mosteller stimulus-response learning)
[ ] Identify and document the agent base class interface for contributors


=== NEW ENVIRONMENTS ===

[ ] Delayed reinforcement chamber (configurable delay between response and reinforcer)
[ ] Multiple-schedule environment (signaled schedule components, e.g. mult VI EXT)
[ ] Concurrent-chains procedure (initial link -> terminal link structure)
[ ] Progressive ratio environment (ratio requirement increases after each reinforcer)
[ ] Free-operant avoidance (Sidman avoidance paradigm)


=== DATA ANALYSIS FEATURES ===

[ ] Matching law analysis
    - Generalized matching equation fit (log response ratio vs log reinforcement ratio)
    - Sensitivity (a) and bias (b) parameters with standard errors
    - Per-condition and across-condition analysis
[ ] Rate calculations
    - Response rate over time (moving window)
    - Reinforcement rate over time
    - Changeover rate between alternatives
[ ] Statistical summaries
    - Mean, SD, median response counts per condition
    - Inter-response time (IRT) distributions
    - Post-reinforcement pause duration
[ ] Curve fitting
    - Hyperbolic discounting fits
    - Demand curve analysis (if consumption paradigm added)
[ ] Export enhancements
    - Summary statistics in CSV/JSON downloads
    - Per-condition CSV sheets
    - R-ready / Python-ready formatted output


=== FRONTEND ENHANCEMENTS ===

[ ] Response rate chart (responses/min over time, complementing cumulative record)
[ ] Save/load experiment configurations (localStorage or file import/export)
[ ] Comparison mode: run same config with different algorithms side-by-side
[ ] Parameter sweep mode: vary one parameter across a range, plot outcome
[ ] Code splitting (vite build chunk is 564KB, should split recharts)
[ ] Mobile-responsive layout
[ ] Dark mode support
[ ] Accessibility audit (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels)


=== DOCUMENTATION ===

[ ] Architecture doc explaining backend/frontend interaction
[ ] Algorithm documentation (theory, parameters, expected behavior)
[ ] Environment documentation (state spaces, action spaces, reinforcement mechanics)
[ ] API reference (auto-generated from FastAPI /docs, but also static docs)
[ ] User guide with example experiments
    - Matching law demonstration
    - Behavioral momentum demonstration
    - Resurgence demonstration
[ ] Update README with:
    - Multi-condition experiment instructions
    - Cumulative record chart description
    - Roadmap section linking to this file


=== KNOWN ISSUES ===

[ ] Port 8000 conflict on some systems (consider configurable port)
[ ] CORS set to allow_origins=["*"] (fine for dev, restrict for production)
[ ] 5 moderate npm audit vulnerabilities (review and address)
[ ] Vite proxy hardcoded to localhost:8000 (should use env var)
[ ] Multi-condition: toggling off then on resets all conditions (by design,
    but could optionally preserve them)


=== MERGE STRATEGY ===

[ ] Merge dev -> main when current feature set is stable
[ ] Establish branch protection rules on main (require PR, require CI pass)
[ ] Tag releases with semantic versioning (v0.1.0 for initial public release)
